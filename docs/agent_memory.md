# Agent Memory for Gourbot Project

## Project Overview
The project appears to be a Go-based application named "Gourbot". It includes various components such as configuration, logging, models, storage, and a Telegram bot implementation. The project structure is modular, with internal packages for different functionalities.

## Workspace Structure
- **cmd/gourbot**: Contains the main entry point for the application.
- **internal/config**: Handles configuration logic.
- **internal/logger**: Manages logging functionality.
- **internal/models**: Defines data models, such as `tguser`.
- **internal/storage**: Implements storage-related logic.
- **internal/tgbot**: Contains the Telegram bot logic.
- **internal/types**: Defines types used across the application.
- **docs**: Includes documentation files.
- **logs**: Stores log files.

## Key Files
- `go.mod` and `go.sum`: Manage dependencies.
- `Makefile`: Likely used for build automation.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project.

## Notes
- The project uses Go modules for dependency management.
- The `internal` directory follows Go's convention for encapsulating code that is not meant to be imported by external projects.
- The `docs` folder will serve as a repository for documentation, including this memory file.

## Purpose of This File
This file serves as a persistent memory for the project. It is intended to:
- Document the current state of the project, including its structure, key files, and components.
- Record thoughts, decisions, and insights during development.
- Provide continuity in case of session interruptions or context loss.
